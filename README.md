Space multiplayer is a game made in one week as part of my master at IIM by group of 2.
The objective was to make an online game without using unity's multiplayer plugin,
Using Enet we made a game that supports prediction and reconciliation.
We also learn to serialize data efficiently, snapshot interpolation, state synchronization and more.
